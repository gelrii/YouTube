# YouTube

A simple user interface for youtube-dl created in bash.

You can run this script quickly with the following command:
<pre>curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gelrii/YouTube/master/YouTube.sh -o /tmp/YouTube.sh && sh /tmp/YouTube.sh</pre>

The above command uses curl, paste this into a terminal to execute it.

This script will download the videos into /home/user/Videos/channel_name/ using the default file name for youtube-dl. It will also use the '-f best' option to download better videos.
